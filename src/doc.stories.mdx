| minWidth | Minimum width (in pixels) of the column
| pinned | Determines whether a column is pinned to one side of the grid or the other |
| resizable | Allows the column to be resized by rendering a resizer element in the column header |
| rowSpanComparator | A function that compares adjacent cells in the same column and determines where row span boundaries lie |
| rowSpanning | Determines whether a column has the ability to span rows |
| sortable | Determines whether the sort control is displayed in the column heaer |
| sortStates | The list of sort modes to cycle through when sorting a column |

## Constraints

CSS Grid layout is the underlying technology used to render your grid data. Browser impose a limits on the number of rows/columns one can render for a grid. Therefore, you'll likely see warnings if you're rendering cells in thousands. If you're attempting to render thousands of cells, it's recommended to use the `virtual` prop to improve performance by limiting the number of cells rendered at any given time.
