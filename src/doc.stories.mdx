# Cantal

## Overview

Cantal is a lightweight but powerful grid library for React. Its primary responsibilities are rendering the layout of the grid and exposing grid events. It comes with sane defaults and it's highly customizable.

## Motivation

Cantal aims to offer the capabilities that come with an enterprise offering in a very lightweight package. You can kind of think of Cantal is a combination of the best parts of Tanstack Table and AG-Grid.

## Features

- Accessible
- Custom styles
- Column resizing
- Multi-column sorting
- Column filtering
- Column grouping
- Column pinning
- Row spanning
- Column spanning
- Focus management
- Cell, row, and range selection
- Advanced copy / paste
- Cell editing
- Virtualization

## Grid props

| Prop name | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| body      | A function that returns the body component |
| columnDefs | An array of objects containing properties that determine the number of columns and their behavior. See the [**Column definitions**](#column-definitions) section below for details |
| columnFilters | An object that tracks the state of each column's current filter value. The object keys represent the column and the values represent the filter value |
| columnSorts | An object that tracks the state of each column's current sort mode. The object keys represent the column and the values represent the sort mode |
| columnSpans | A reference to the key of the column spanning definitions on the row data object, e.g. "columnSpansKey" where the data object might look like `{ fieldA: 1, ..., columnSpansKey: [{ field: 'spanIdOrField', from: 0, to: 1 }] }`. See the [**Column spanning**](#column-spanning) section below for details  |
| data | An array of objects where each object represents a row of data |
| focusedCell | Represents the cell that currently has focus. TODO
| gap | Defines the spacing (in pixels) between each cell. Accepts an integer or an object, e.g. `{ columnGap: 1, rowGap: 1 }` |
| handleColumnFilter | |
| handleColumnSort | |
| handleFocusedCellChange | |
| handleKeyDown | |
| handlePointerDown | |
| handleResize | |
| handleSelection | |
| header | |
| id | |
| overscanColumns | |
| overscanRows | |
| rowHeight | |
| selectedRanges | |
| selectionFollowsFocus | |
| styles | |
| virtual | |

## <a name="column-definitions"></a>Column definitions

Column definitions determine a lot of the behavior of the grid. Below is a list of all the column definition properties Cantal knows about:

| Key | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| ariaCellLabel | Sets the `aria-label` attribute of the cells in the column |
| ariaHeaderCellLabel | Sets the `aria-label` attribute of the column header cells |
| field | A required property that's used to look up the value from the data row object |
| filterable | Determines whether the filter control is displayed in the column header |
| filterer | Used for defined your own custom filter component that's displayed in the column header |
| minWidth | Minimum width (in pixels) of the column
| pinned | Determines whether a column is pinned to one side of the grid or the other |
| resizable | Allows the column to be resized by rendering a resizer element in the column header |
| rowSpanComparator | A function that compares adjacent cells in the same column and determines where row span boundaries lie |
| rowSpanning | Determines whether a column has the ability to span rows |
| sortable | Determines whether the sort control is displayed in the column heaer |
| sortStates | The list of sort modes to cycle through when sorting a column |
| subcolumns | The list of child column definitions that fall under the defining column definition |
| title | The column header label text |
| valueRenderer | A function that's responsible for the rendered output of the cell |
| width | Sets the initial width of the column |

## Constraints

CSS Grid layout is the underlying technology used to render your grid data. Browser impose a limits on the number of rows/columns one can render for a grid. Therefore, you'll likely see warnings if you're rendering cells in thousands. If you're attempting to render thousands of cells, it's recommended to use the `virtual` prop to improve performance by limiting the number of cells rendered at any given time.

## <a name="column-spanning"></a>Column spanning

Column spanning is one of the few features that is defined by a data row object.
